# Improved-Portfolio

## Description

My Application was designed to take a previous portfolio assignment and enhance it to be employer competitive. I created a stylized card with the intention to make it easier for employers to navigate to my LinkedIn and Github profile. I also used materialize for formatting, styling, mobile compatability and to create a parallax effect on the different htmls to make my portfolio stand out.
